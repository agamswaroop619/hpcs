# HPCS      :    Hydrophonic Control System

Abstract   :   This is an IOT-based product in which we showcase our vision for future if Gardening and Agriculture or as we like to term it "SMART-GARDENING".

Progress Tracker     :     We first plan to showcase our code through a Raspberry Pi Stimulation on Day 1, followed by a close to complete prototype circuits version on Day 2. The project with be completely showcased in its full glory on Day 3.

Problem Statement    :  The negative impacts of conventional farming practices necessitate the need for sustainable alternatives. Vertical hydroponic systems offer a promising solution, but the lack of awareness and funding impedes their adoption. Support is needed to promote sustainable agriculture and mitigate environmental damage.

Solution    : Vertical hydroponic systems offer several advantages over conventional farming methods. They are space-efficient, water-efficient, and offer better yields. They are also easy to maintain, accessible, and sustainable. Compared to conventional farming, vertical hydroponic systems can help reduce soil depletion, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and food safety concerns. Investing in vertical hydroponic systems can promote sustainable agriculture while also generating revenue and supporting local communities.

Q/A      : 
# 1)What is the need of an Automatic Hydrophonic system if manual is cheaper?
   Hydroponics requires precise environmental control, which can be challenging manually.
   Automatic hydroponic control systems using sensors and microprocessors provide a solution while being ever so slightly more precise.
   Thus, creating a more economically optimised route.

# 2)What are the equipment and what is their respective use?
    DHT22  :    Soil Moisture
    NPK    :    Nutrient Supply
    DHT11  :    Temperature Sensor
    
# 3)How do you plan to access the data provided by the sensors?
   We plan to access the data provided by the sensors using thr open - source API calling tool  :  Mycodo.
   Nycodo essentially lightens our work by it's great UI design that helps us to control our sensors with ease.
    

Code of all avaiable sensors has been checked and complied
