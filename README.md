# HPCS      :    Hydrophonic Control System

Abstract:
This is an IOT-based product in which we showcase our vision for future if Gardening and Agriculture or as we like to term it "SMART-GARDENING".
We first plan to showcase our code through a Raspberry Pi Stimulation on Day 1, followed by a close to complete prototype version on Day 2. The project with be completely showcased in its full glory on Day 3.


# 1)What is the need of an Automatic Hydrophonic system if manual is cheaper?
   Hydroponics requires precise environmental control, which can be challenging manually.
   Automatic hydroponic control systems using sensors and microprocessors provide a solution while being ever so slightly more precise.
   Thus, creating a more economically optimised route.

# 2)What are the equipment and what is their respective use?
    DHT22  :    Soil Moisture
    NPK    :    Nutrient Supply
    DHT11  :    Temperature Sensor
    
# 3)How do you plan to access the data provided by the sensors?
   We plan to access the data provided by the sensors using thr open - source API calling tool  :  Mycodo.
   Nycodo essentially lightens our work by it's great UI design that helps us to control our sensors with ease.
    

Code of all avaiable sensors has been checked and complied
